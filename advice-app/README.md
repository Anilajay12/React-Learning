# Advice App



### This is a simple App to fetch the advice from Advice API

<br/>

#### In this project used below react topics:

```
    useState - To render the data whenever we click the button
    useEffect - It will load the data, initally before rendering the page
    Components - Created Re usable Component
    Props - To pass the parameters from one component to other component
```

<br />

### API To fetch the data from Advice:


Here, I have used Fetch Method to retrieve the data from API. It is a async method.

```
    const res = await fetch('https://api.adviceslip.com/advice');
```
